      <p>This project is from 2012, when I was studying at the Yoobee School of Design (previously Natcoll). T2 is an Australia brand selling teas and tea-related products. Special product packaging and a series of related products are promoted under a sub-brand of T2 called ‘Poker-Tea’.</p>

      <p>Poker-Tea is using the element of poker, and other middle ages concepts, to give the product a distinctive style while people are consuming T2 tea. At this point Poker-Tea in New Zealand is trying to take tea into novel roles as not only beverages, but also enjoyable collectables and gifts.</p>
